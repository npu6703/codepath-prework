## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
Favorite apps:
- Instagram: 
    able to see other people's stories
    sharing notes feature
    different fonts 
- Tiktok:
    song's recommendation for picture/video
    repost the video 
- Pinterest:
    search one picture and click on it, it will recommend other similar vibe pictures
    saved albums with pictures 

An app idea: I want to build a Photobooth IOS version that look vintage and aesthetic
